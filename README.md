# Togethdao Introduction

## A brief introduction: why we want to build TogethDAO? 

TogethDAO, to get ETH. As the name illustrated, TogethDAO is built to help users get access to Ethereum in a more cost-efficient way. **We are all TOGETHer to participate in the TogethDAO !**

The initial idea of this DAO is inspired by ConstitutionDAO. Several friends of mine wanted to participate in the donation and they are all sick of the high transaction cost on Ethereum. Some of them just wanted to put 50 USDT but the transaction fee may cost more than 100 USDT. So we decided to collect our funds together to make the donation and get PEOPLE tokens to hold by only one address.
Although there are lots of different public chains or technologies featuring on lowering the transaction fees on Ethereum, however, they failed to fulfill one important mission: how to let users participate in the project which is only available on Ethereum mainnet. And that’s why TogethDAO come out.

## What is TogethDAO? 
TogethDAO focuses on lowering the threshold of users’ access to Ethereum, to be more specific, you can get access to the original Ethereum project but pay much less transaction cost. We partnered with XXX(public chain) and XXX(cross bridge) to facilitate this process. Those who want to target some Ethereum projects can set a proposal thus opening a DAO in our protocol. After setting some parameters, the crowdfunding process begins and whoever wants to participate in the same investment could send their funds to the DAO contract. When the amount reaches the target, all funds will be collected together and go through a bridge to get to Ethereum to purchase the assets. All participants will share the transaction cost.

BUT! That’s not the end of TogethDAO’s story. All the above function is just the very first step of our journey. TogethDAO’s mission is to become a basic framework for those who want to lower their interaction cost with Ethereum. It is not only designed for the end user, but it also provides a set of toolkits for all the developers to shape it in the ways they want.

## More 
For end-users, in the near future you may be able to use TogethDAO to:

- Collect funds to share the cost of your investment
- Recommend a new promising token if you are a KOL and want to get more intention.
- Manage other’s funds to maximize the investment profit if you are an experienced asset manager
- Leverage other’s funds to purchase an expensive NFT (such as land in Sandbox) and operate it and share the profit with all your supporters
- Participate in IDO of some project which you’ve not qualified the whitelist

For experienced developers, you may contribute to TogethDAO in the following ways:

- you can design a set of strategy to trade the target tokens and provide as an option for others to use
- You can also provide deeper interaction function for the project such as mint or stake or whatever project originally offers.
- If you are interested in the governce function, you can also provide different voting strategies for DAO users to choose.
- Or you may think the share of the DAO is lack of liquidity, you could design a way to tokenized the DAO share to provide more liquidity for DAO users
- Even you can develop a DAO of some selected proposals, which means TogethDAO of TogethDAO. The combination is endless.
